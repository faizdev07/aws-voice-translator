ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest AWS project: Voice Translator!

I've built a real-time voice translation application using AWS AI services that can translate speech between 16 different languages instantly.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
- Record voice directly in the browser
- Support for 16 languages including Hindi
- Real-time transcription, translation, and speech synthesis
- Fully serverless architecture

ðŸ”¹ AWS Services Used:
- Amazon S3 & CloudFront for hosting
- API Gateway & Lambda for processing
- Amazon Transcribe for speech-to-text
- Amazon Translate for text translation
- Amazon Polly for text-to-speech

This project demonstrates how AWS AI services can be combined to create powerful, user-friendly applications with minimal infrastructure management.
